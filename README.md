A SHORT DESCRIPTION ABOUT BANKING SYSTEM

This program is a simple banking system implemented in Python. It consists of two classes: Account and Bank. The Account class represents individual user accounts, storing details such as username, password, account number, address, Aadhar number, branch code, mobile number, and account balance. The Bank class manages user authentication, account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking functionalities. Users can create accounts, login securely, perform financial transactions, and inquire about their account balances through a user-friendly command-line interface.

The Bank class provides essential banking functionalities, including account creation, login authentication, and transaction processing. Upon account creation, users input their personal information, including username, password, address, Aadhar number, branch code, mobile number, and initial balance. The program securely manages user credentials and allows authenticated users to perform financial operations such as depositing and withdrawing funds. Additionally, users can check their account balances at any time, ensuring transparency and control over their finances. This simple yet effective banking system demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and data management in Python, providing users with a convenient and secure platform for managing their finances.
